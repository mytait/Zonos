Zonos-v0.1 is a leading open-weight text-to-speech model trained on more than 200k hours of varied multilingual speech, delivering expressiveness and quality on par with—or even surpassing—top TTS providers.

Our model enables highly natural speech generation from text prompts when given a speaker embedding or audio prefix, and can accurately perform speech cloning when given a reference clip spanning just a few seconds. The conditioning setup also allows for fine control over speaking rate, pitch variation, audio quality, and emotions such as happiness, fear, sadness, and anger. The model outputs speech natively at 44kHz.

##### For more details and speech samples, check out our blog [here](https://www.zyphra.com/post/beta-release-of-zonos-v0-1)

##### We also have a hosted version available at [maia.zyphra.com/audio](https://maia.zyphra.com/audio)

Zonos follows a straightforward architecture: text normalization and phonemization via eSpeak, followed by DAC token prediction through a transformer or hybrid backbone. An overview of the architecture can be seen below.

## Usage

### Python

```python

import torch
import torchaudio
from zonos.model import Zonos
from zonos.conditioning import make_cond_dict

# model = Zonos.from_pretrained("Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-hybrid", device="cuda")
model = Zonos.from_pretrained("Zyphra/Zonos-v0.1-transformer", device="cuda")

wav, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load("assets/exampleaudio.mp3")
speaker = model.make_speaker_embedding(wav, sampling_rate)

cond_dict = make_cond_dict(text="Hello, world!", speaker=speaker, language="en-us")
conditioning = model.prepare_conditioning(cond_dict)

codes = model.generate(conditioning)

wavs = model.autoencoder.decode(codes).cpu()
torchaudio.save("sample.wav", wavs[0], model.autoencoder.sampling_rate)
```

### Gradio interface (recommended)

```bash
python gradio_interface.py
```

**FOR WINDOWS**: Gradio will ask you to use adress: 0.0.0.0:7860. That does not work! **use http://127.0.0.1:7860/ instead**

_For repeated sampling we highly recommend using the gradio interface instead, as the minimal example needs to load the model every time it is run._

## Features

- Zero-shot TTS with voice cloning: Input desired text and a 10-30s speaker sample to generate high quality TTS output
- Audio prefix inputs: Add text plus an audio prefix for even richer speaker matching. Audio prefixes can be used to elicit behaviours such as whispering which can otherwise be challenging to replicate when cloning from speaker embeddings
- Multilingual support: Zonos-v0.1 supports English, Japanese, Chinese, French, and German
- Audio quality and emotion control: Zonos offers fine-grained control of many aspects of the generated audio. These include speaking rate, pitch, maximum frequency, audio quality, and various emotions such as happiness, anger, sadness, and fear.
- Fast: our model runs with a real-time factor of ~2x on an RTX 4090 (i.e. generates 2 seconds of audio per 1 second of compute time)
- Gradio WebUI: Zonos comes packaged with an easy to use gradio interface to generate speech
- Simple installation and deployment: Zonos can be installed and deployed simply using the docker file packaged with our repository.

## Installation

See also [Docker Installation](#docker-installation)

**GPU:** Project supports recent NVIDIA GPUs (3000-series or newer, 6GB+ VRAM).

**Linux:** (preferably Ubuntu 22.04/24.04)

**Windows:** tested on 11

### Setup environment

create a python 3.10 environment and clone the repository into it.


Zonos depends on the eSpeak library phonemization. 

**Linux:**

```bash
apt install -y espeak-ng
```

**windows:**

either run this in a command shell with administrator rights:

```
winget install --id=eSpeak-NG.eSpeak-NG  -e
```

or use the lastest installer from their github:

```
https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases
```

### Install project

```
pip install -r requirements1.txt -r requirements2.txt 
``` 


##### Confirm that it's working

For convenience we provide a minimal example to check that the installation works:

```bash
python sample.py
```

## Docker installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos.git
cd Zonos

# For gradio
docker compose up

# Or for development you can do
docker build -t zonos .
docker run -it --gpus=all --net=host -v /path/to/Zonos:/Zonos -t zonos
cd /Zonos
python sample.py # this will generate a sample.wav in /Zonos
```
